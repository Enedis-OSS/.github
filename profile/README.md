## üéØ Motivation  <a id="Motivation"></a>
### An Open Source Ready Policy at the Enedis IT Department
The Enedis IT Department has embarked on an Open Source policy since march 2016 with a proactive approach to promoting Open Source solutions within the company. By the end of 2021, it is reinforcing this commitment with the establishment of an Open Source Ready policy, supported by a dedicated governance structure to coordinate actions within the IT Department.

### Enedis and the Open Source Community
Enedis is one of the founding members:
    
- of [**TOSIT**](https://tosit.fr/), an associative structure that supports Open Source. Its aim is to promote the development of code, software, and IT solutions under open source and/or free licenses, particularly in the field of cybersecurity.  
- of [**Hermine**](https://gitlab.com/hermine-project/hermine), a legal compliance software.

Feel free to take a look at our colleagues' [**EDF GitHub organisation!**](https://github.com/groupe-edf). 

## üëäüèª Our Projects  <a id="Ourproject"></a>
Our Open Source projects and contributions include the following (with more on their ways !) :

- [**mocha-xray-reporter**](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS/mocha-xray-reporter), is a library that retrieves Cypress test results to automatically generate Xray test execution reports. Its primary advantage is that it bridges the gap between testers and developers by automatically uploading Cypress screenshots as evidence to Xray.
