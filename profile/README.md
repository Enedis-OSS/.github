## üéØ Motivation  <a id="Motivation"></a>
### An Open Source Ready Policy at the Enedis IT Department
The Enedis IT Department has embarked on an Open Source policy since march 2016 with a proactive approach to promoting Open Source solutions within the company. By the end of 2021, it is reinforcing this commitment with the establishment of an Open Source Ready policy, supported by a dedicated governance structure to coordinate actions within the IT Department.

### Enedis and the Open Source Community
Enedis is one of the founding members:
    
- of [**TOSIT**](https://tosit.fr/), an associative structure that supports Open Source. Its aim is to promote the development of code, software, and IT solutions under open source and/or free licenses, particularly in the field of cybersecurity.  
- of [**Hermine**](https://gitlab.com/hermine-project/hermine), a legal compliance software.

Feel free to take a look at our colleagues' [**EDF GitHub organisation!**](https://github.com/groupe-edf). 

## üëäüèª Our Projects  <a id="Ourproject"></a>
Our Open Source projects and contributions include the following (with more on their ways !) :

- [**mocha-xray-reporter**](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS/mocha-xray-reporter), generate a xray compatible report from Cypress tests. It can be usefull for Acceptance Testing by automatically adding screenshots to the report as proofs.
- [**chutney**](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS/chutney) stands out for its simple and flexible approach to integration test automation, focusing on complex scenarios and end-to-end testing.
- [**grafana-dsl**](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS/grafana-dsl) is a Kotlin-based domain-specific language designed to simplify and automate the creation of Grafana dashboards as code, enabling teams to manage observability assets more efficiently and consistently.
-  [**TIC2Zigbee**](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS/TIC2Zigbee) This document outlines the Zigbee clusters, attributes, and commands utilized in the implementation of an ERL interface. It also details the mapping between TIC fields and the Zigbee attributes and commands associated with the ERL interface (Device ID 0x0509). While this data mapping is not mandatory, it is recommended by Enedis.
- [**TIC2WebSocket**](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS/TIC2WebSocket) is used as a generic interface for accessing the Tele Information Client (TIC). TIC2WebSocket provides a WebSocket-based API for managing and interfacing with TIC data, enabling real-time communication and data exchange for client telemetry information.
- [**tic4eebus**](https://github.com/Enedis-OSS/tic4eebus) is used as a energy management system (referred as EnergyGuard in EEBUS documentation) using Linky customer interface (known as T√©l√© Information Client or TIC) as metering source to control electrical vehicle charge through a wallbox (i.e the EEBUS interface).
